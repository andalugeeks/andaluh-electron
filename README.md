## Description

The **Andalusian varieties of [Spanish]** (Spanish: *andaluz*; Andalusian) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Further info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish.

This app uses the [Andaluh-js](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-js).

As there's no official or standard andaluz spelling, andaluh-js is adopting the **EPA proposal (Er Prinzipito Andaluh)**. Further info: https://andaluhepa.wordpress.com. Other andaluz spelling proposals are planned to be added as well.

## Run

Andaluh-electron requires `nodejs` >= 12.x.x to run. Running is as simple as installing dependencies with `npm install` and then running the scripts `npm run-script start:react` and `npm run-script start:electron` as follows:

```
$ npm install

> core-js@2.6.11 postinstall ~/andaluh-electron/node_modules/babel-runtime/node_modules/core-js
> node -e "try{require('./postinstall')}catch(e){}"

Thank you for using core-js ( https://github.com/zloirock/core-js ) for polyfilling JavaScript standard library!

*Note*: You may have to run the two scripts of the last command above on different terminals.

## Build

Thanks to `electron-builder` several packages (`deb`, `rpm`, `snap (unsigned)`, `appImage`) are build with a single command: `npm run-script build`.  You need to have the following dependencies installed in order to generate the packages: `dpkg`, `rpm`, `snap`.


```
$ npm run-script build
